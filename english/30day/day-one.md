### Success in Life
- Success means different things for different people. Some may equate it with fame, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments For me, it means fulfilling one's dreams.Whatever your dreams are, you have a goal there and then focus all your attention on it.
- 成功对不同的人有不同的意义。有些人可能把它等同于名声，有些人等同于财富，还有一些人等同于成就。对我来说，它意味着实现一个人的梦想。无论你的梦想是什么，你都有一个目标，然后把所有的注意力都集中在这个目标上。

- Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process of struggling for it, you cry, sweat,complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles youhave gone through. So an old proverb says thatthe sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.

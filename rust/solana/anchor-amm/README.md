# 💧 Anchor AMM Boilerplate

A minimal **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** implementation built using the **Anchor framework** on Solana. This project serves as a boilerplate for developers looking to understand or extend the fundamentals of on-chain liquidity pools.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo provides a clean, readable foundation for an Anchor-based AMM, ideal for:

- Learning how to build token swap mechanisms
- Understanding liquidity pool dynamics
- Prototyping custom AMMs on Solana

---

## ⚙️ Features

- AMM Pool initialization
- Liquidity provisioning (deposit/remove)
- Token swapping logic
- Anchor framework structure

---
## 🧪 Usage

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & Yarn
- [Anchor CLI](https://book.anchor-lang.com/getting_started/installation.html)

### Build the Program

```
anchor build
```

### Run Tests

```
anchor test
```

## 🔍 Notes
This boilerplate is learning purposes. 
This can be extended and you can add features such as:
- Fee mechanics
- Time-weighted average pricing
- LP token tracking
- Advanced invariant curves (e.g., stable swaps)
